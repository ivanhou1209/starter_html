            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>
